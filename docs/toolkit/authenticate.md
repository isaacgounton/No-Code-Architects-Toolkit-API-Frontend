# Authenticate Endpoint Documentation

## 1. Overview

The `/v1/toolkit/authenticate` endpoint is a part of the `v1_toolkit_auth` blueprint in the Flask application. Its purpose is to authenticate requests by verifying the provided API key against a predefined value. This endpoint serves as a gatekeeper for accessing other protected endpoints within the API.

## 2. Endpoint

- **URL Path**: `/v1/toolkit/authenticate`
- **HTTP Method**: `GET`

## 3. Request

### Headers

- `X-API-Key` (required): The API key to be verified for authentication.

### Body Parameters

This endpoint does not require any request body parameters.

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" http://localhost:8080/v1/toolkit/authenticate
```

## 4. Response

### Success Response

If the provided API key matches the predefined value (`API_KEY` environment variable), the endpoint will return a 200 OK status code with the following response:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "endpoint": "/authenticate",
  "id": null,
  "job_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-g7h8-i9j0-k1l2m3n4o5p6",
  "message": "success",
  "pid": 12345,
  "queue_id": 1234567890,
  "queue_length": 0,
  "response": "Authorized",
  "run_time": 0.001,
  "total_time": 0.001,
  "build_number": "1.0.0"
}
```

### Error Responses

If the provided API key does not match the predefined value, the endpoint will return a 401 Unauthorized status code with the following response:

```json
{
  "code": 401,
  "endpoint": "/authenticate",
  "id": null,
  "job_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-g7h8-i9j0-k1l2m3n4o5p6",
  "message": "Unauthorized",
  "pid": 12345,
  "queue_id": 1234567890,
  "queue_length": 0,
  "response": null,
  "run_time": 0.001,
  "total_time": 0.001,
  "build_number": "1.0.0"
}
```

## 5. Error Handling

The main error that can occur with this endpoint is providing an invalid or missing API key. In such cases, the endpoint will return a 401 Unauthorized status code with an appropriate error message.

## 6. Usage Notes

- This endpoint is designed to be used as a gatekeeper for other protected endpoints within the API.
- The API key must be provided in the `X-API-Key` header for every request to this endpoint.
- The API key is typically a secret value that should be kept secure and not shared publicly.

## 7. Common Issues

- Forgetting to include the `X-API-Key` header in the request.
- Providing an incorrect or invalid API key.

## 8. Best Practices

- Keep the API key secure and avoid storing it in plaintext or committing it to version control systems.
- Consider implementing additional security measures, such as rate limiting or IP whitelisting, to further protect the authentication endpoint.
- Regularly rotate or update the API key to enhance security.
